		<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>The reason I chose this Banana Bread recipe is because my mom has been making it for about a year or two now,<br>and is my mom's favorite thing to bake. Many of her friends think that both her gluten free and regular banana breads<br>are the best thing she bakes. This is also one of the first recipes she learned how to bake.</p>

		<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The recipe calls for walnuts, but if you are allergic you do not have to add the walnuts</li>
			<li>You also do not need to keep that banana bread in the fridge if you prefer eating the bread hot, but if you want to keep the bread for a longer period of time, I think that you should not skip this step</li>
		</ul>
