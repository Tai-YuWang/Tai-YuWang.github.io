## Angle Relationships

- These 5 angles prove that line are parallel 

|Angle Pair                  | Description    |
|----------------------------|----------------|
|Alternate Interior Angeles  | They are both equal to each other |
|Alternate Exterior Angles   | They are both equal to each other |
|Same Side Interior Angles   | They are equal to 180             |
|Same Side Exterior Agnles   | They are equal to 180             |
|Correspoing Angles          | They are both equal to each other |

- These 2 do not prove that lines are parallel

|Angle Pair                  | Description                       |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|Vertical Angles             | They are both equal to each other |
|Linear Pair                 | They are equal to 180             |

## Some examples of what certain angle relationships look like are above

- 6 and 4, as well as 5 and 3, are examples of alternate interior angles
- 7 and 1, as well as 8 and 2, are examples of alternate exterior angles
- 3 and 6, as well as 4 and 5, are examples of same side interior angles
- 1 and 8, as well as 2 and 7, are examples of same side exterior angles
- 2 and 6, 3 and 7, 1 and 5, and finally 4 and 8 are examples of corresponding angles
- 2 and 4, 1 and 3, 5 and 7, and 8 and 6, are all examples of vertical angles
- 1 and 2, 4 and 3, 5 and 6, and 8 and 7 are only some of the linear pairs in this digram

|Shapes               | Area Formula                  |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
|Square/Rectangle     |A = lw                         |
|Triangle             |A = $\frac{b}{h}$              |
|Circle               |A = $\pi r^{2}$                |
|Hexagon              |A = $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a^{2}$ |
