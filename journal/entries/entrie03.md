- These 5 angles prove that line are parallel 

|Angle Pair                  | Description    |
|----------------------------|----------------|
|Alternate Interior Angeles  | They are both equal to each other |
|Alternate Exterior Angles   | They are both equal to each other |
|Same Side Interior Angles   | They are equal to 180             |
|Same Side Exterior Agnles   | They are equal to 180             |
|Correspoing Angles          | They are both equal to each other |

- These 2 do not prove that lines are parallel

|Angle Pair                  | Description                       |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|Vertical Angles             | They are both equal to each other |
