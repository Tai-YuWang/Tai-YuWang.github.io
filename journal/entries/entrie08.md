# This is my project

I did my project with vibe coding and made blackjack with AI. What I struggled with is that the AI kept breaking my game and made it stop working, or fonts and colors of the words were wrong. When I first told the ai to make the game, it did it, but it was very barebone and needed LOTS of fine tuning and changes to make it the blackjack most people know and love.
