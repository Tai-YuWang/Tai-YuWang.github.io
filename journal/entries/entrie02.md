#Encryption Activity

## What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

- Symmetric encryption is when the encrypted data uses a single key that both computers know. Asymmetric encryption is when there are two keys, a public key, and a private key. The public key is used as the lock to encrypt the data, and the private key is used to unlocked the encrypted data.

##Explain the steps of the encryption and decryption process

- Using asymmetric encryption the process starts with the sender using the recievers pubic to encryptn the message. Then the resiever uses their private key to decrypt the message. For symmetric encryption both users use the same shared key to encrypt and decrypt the message.

## Why is it important that you never share your secret key?

- It is important that you never reveal your secret key because then people can see all of the data sent to you. And the person with your secret key can find all of your private information.
