# Journal about command line tools

## Summarize the importance of each of these tools:

- The terminal allows you to code, create files, make and add to a website.

- Git allows me to add to my website.

- Vim allows me to edit longer documents in a pretty easily.

- Markdown allows you to write pieces of text easier and can allow you to create headings, bullet points, and more.

## Share how you're feeling so far about all of this new technology:

- I like the new things I've learned about how to use the terminal better. I'm getting better and better on using the new things I've learned in class.

## Give advice for future students who are interested in learning them:

- I would say that you should research on exactly how to use the code and practice how to use the code and to get in the habit of using the code.
